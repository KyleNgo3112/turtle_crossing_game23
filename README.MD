This project is a simple arcade-style "turtle crossing" game built using Python's turtle module. The objective is to guide the turtle safely across a road filled with moving cars. The turtle advances by pressing the "Up" arrow key, and each successful crossing increases the difficulty by speeding up the cars. If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends.

Features
- Player control using the "Up" arrow key to move the turtle.
- Randomly generated cars that move horizontally across the screen.
- A scoreboard that tracks the current level.
- The game increases in difficulty with each successful crossing as cars speed up.
